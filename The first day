I arrived at the event very early and was with open heart for the experience just wanted to learn the best of all 
The first day was full of lectures
The most tecnichal ones was the ones with less people, for example i atend to one lecture about zkproof, is has almost no ones, and most people was justing using the cell phone there not payng attention
That one was a great lecture for me
We had a massive lectures about the regulametation of the crypto assets, a lot of focus on that, and that annon vibe wasn't very powrfull on that day
At the same time i felt that most of the guys that was doing this lectures, didn't have enough knoadgle about the crypto market itself, was just some businnes guys talking about that own product and the crypto part was not a big deal
Was much more the business inside the cryptoword and now the crypto inside the business
