So just a fast backgrounf of who am I, i have been inside the Web3 word for more than 4 years, and specific inside defi word, always find the best paths to alocated my money and the best opportunites that i see
Doing complete reasearches just by myself in the specific crypto market segments that i want to follow, one of them,it's airdrops, but also yield sekking,arbitrage and everything releted to the defi word is part of my daily job

#Inicial Impressions
The event was very good i liked to be there with the community, but a lot of things stand out to me
First , the event was much more focus on the instituinal path and much more classic market overview, bitcoin, regulation,discussion about the global situation of the market
The defi word was something very low explored and still looks like something brend new to most of people there, there wasn't much defi thing and was not very popular there 
But is was very interesting to be in touch with the things that was in the mainstreen and see the window of growht that defi still have.
I fell like sometimes we are so integrated with the market that this don't fell new anymore, fells casual and very common,but we forget that we are still just a little percent of thhe whole financial market
Other thing that cough my attention was the the sponsors of the event, most of them was just exchanges, this desapointed me a lit bit, but at the same time i understand that this guys is the ones that have the potential to bring the money to sponsor an event and make this happens
But at same hand there was a lot of crypto payment alternatives, a lot of guys oferring that cryptocards , and something that was a real up trend being explroed there
